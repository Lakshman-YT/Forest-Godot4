* Dynamic atmosphere, fog, and clouds that change with the day cycle
* Consolidated controls to manage lighting and camera exposure
* Management of game time: current time, day length, day or night

## Installation

* Clone or download the repository. 
* Open the project in Godot and run `demo/Sky3DDemo.tscn` to test it.
* Copy `addons/sky_3d` into your project `addons` directory. Create the folder if missing.
* Open `Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins` and enable the plugin. 


## Usage

* Create or open a Scene.
* Remove any existing `WorldEnvironment` node.
* Create a new `Sky3D` node.
* Customize the settings of the `Sky3D`, `Sky3D/Environment`, `TimeOfDay`, `SkyDome`, `SunLight`, and `MoonLight` nodes. Some settings like light energy, color, and angle are driven by Sky3D and not directly changeable on the light nodes. You'll know if they are reset on time updates. Adjust those settings in `Sky3D` or `SkyDome`.


## Compatibility Renderer Note
This render needs a bit of adjustment to show similar results to Vulkan:
* `Sky3D / Sky Contribution = 0.75`
* `SkyDome / Fog / Fog Density = 0.01`


## Documentation

The documentation is built in to Godot. Look for tooltips in the inspector where available, or press F1 and search for `Sky3D`, `SkyDome`, `TimeOfDay`.

The original version of this plugin, *TimeOfDay v1*, was made by [J. Cuéllar](https://twitter.com/JayKuellar) for Godot 3. You can find it in the `godot3` branch. The original repository was deleted. We revived it, ported the GDScript version to Godot 4, and have continued to build on it to produce Sky3D.
